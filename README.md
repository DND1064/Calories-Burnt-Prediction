# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
A machine learning-based application that predicts the number of calories burned based on user-specific data such as age, gender, weight, height, and Duration of Physical work done  . This project helps users track their fitness progress and optimize workouts more effectively.

# Calories Burnt Prediction using Exercise Data

This project predicts the number of calories burned during various exercises using machine learning models. It merges **calories data** and **exercise records** to build an accurate regression-based prediction system.

## Features

- **Data Integration:** Combines calories and exercise datasets using unique user IDs.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling, encoding, and cleaning for better model performance.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations of trends and correlations in exercise and calorie data.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- **Model Evaluation:** RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
